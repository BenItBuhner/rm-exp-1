{"text": "Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming \" lobster red \" on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles ."}
{"text": "= = Description = ="}
{"text": "Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals ."}
{"text": "The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the \" crusher \" , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey ; the other is the \" cutter \" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter ."}
{"text": "The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment ."}
{"text": "The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics :"}
{"text": "The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus ."}
{"text": "The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped ."}
{"text": "The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red ."}
{"text": "= = Life cycle = ="}
{"text": "Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her pleopods . Females carrying eggs are said to be \" berried \" and can be found throughout the year ."}
{"text": "The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on zooplankton . This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the benthic phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives ."}
{"text": "= = Distribution = ="}
{"text": "Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda , inside the Arctic Circle ."}
{"text": "The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the \" midnight @-@ sun lobster \" . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the Oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel ."}
{"text": "Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer pagurus . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin , but the species did not become established there ."}
{"text": "= = Ecology = ="}
{"text": "Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – 492 ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed ."}
{"text": "The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other benthic invertebrates . These include crabs , molluscs , sea urchins , starfish and polychaete worms ."}
{"text": "The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described ."}
{"text": "Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia , caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out ."}
{"text": "= = Human consumption = ="}
{"text": "Homarus gammarus is traditionally \" highly esteemed \" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \" The Crabfish \" a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \" excellent \" white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \" sand vein \" ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour ."}
{"text": "Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) ."}
{"text": "Aquaculture systems for H. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low ."}
{"text": "= = Taxonomic history = ="}
{"text": "Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae , published in 1758 . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans ."}
{"text": "H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including Astacus marinus Fabricius , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 ."}
{"text": "The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by Lipke Holthuis in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near Marstrand , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the paralectotypes have since been lost ."}
